Note that the Google Colab notebook uses the latest package released on PyPI (rather than the development release).\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install the latest release of *skimpy* via\n[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):\n\n```bash\n$ pip install skimpy\n```\n\nTo install the development version from git, use:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install git+https://github.com/aeturrell/skimpy.git\n```\n\nFor development, see [contributing](contributing.qmd).\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), *skimpy* is free and open source software.\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please [file an issue](https://github.com/aeturrell/skimpy/issues) along with a detailed description.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis project was generated from [\\@cjolowicz](https://github.com/cjolowicz)\\'s [Hypermodern Python Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python) template.\n\n**skimpy** was inspired by the R package [**skimr**](https://docs.ropensci.org/skimr/articles/skimr.html) and by exploratory Python packages including [**ydata_profiling**](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai) and [**dataprep**](https://dataprep.ai/), from which the `clean_columns` function comes.\n\nThis package would not have been possible without the [**Rich**](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) package.\n\nThe package is built with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), while the documentation is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [Quartodoc](https://github.com/machow/quartodoc) (a Python package). Tests are run with [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/).\n\nUsing **skimpy** in your paper?
